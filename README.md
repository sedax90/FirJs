## How to install

`npm i @sedax90/firjs`

## Why

I state that this project is freely inspired by the amazing Sequential Workflow Designer: https://github.com/nocode-js/sequential-workflow-designer

**FirJs must not be intended as a ready to use project** but as a simple, generic, dependencies free library for drawing workflows (the only dependencies you will find are for compiling and running the demo).

This library is written entirely in Typescript and was born to remain simple and as agnostic as possible, so that it can be easily integrated into projects where needed.

## Concepts

The main area is your **Workspace**. A _workspace_ contains a **Workflow**, who is simply a _nodes tree_.

FirJs provides only three types of nodes:

- `task` (a generic operation)
- `map` (for/while)
- `choice` (if/switch)

The workflow tree has a basic hierarchical structure:

```
[
	{
		id: "123",
		type: 'task',
		label: "Foo", // Optional
		icon: "star", // Optional
	},
	{
		id: "124",
		type: 'map',
		props: {
			children: []
		}
	}
]
```

You can attach all the data you need in the `props` field, they will always be kept.

## Getting started

Import the library and create a simple JS object:

```
firjs.init({
    parent: document.getElementById('root'),
    tree: [],
}).then((ws) => { // Enjoy! });
```

The library does not do anything automatically (except node removal), you have to use the exposed functions to adapt the library to your needs:

```
onNodeSelect: (e) => void;
onNodeDeselect: (e) => void;
onNodeRemove: (e) => void;
onTreeChange: (e) => void;
```

If you want to implement some logics during node drop or node remove, you can implement:

```
canDropNode: (e) => Promise<boolean>
canRemoveNode: (e) => Promise<boolean>
```

When you implement your drag&drop logic, you have to inform the Workspace that you are going to drop a node on the tree:

```
ws.startDrag(event.target, {
    x: event.pageX,
    y: event.pageY,
}, {
    id: (i++).toString(),
    type: element.dataset.type,
    label: `New node ${i}`, // Optional
});
```

After all, you can pass some options to init for customize some data:

```
style: {
    fontSize: string;
    fontFamily: string;
};
strings: {
    "context-menu.component.actions.remove.label": string,
    "context-menu.component.actions.duplicate.label": string,
    "context-menu.workspace.actions.fitandcenter.label": string,
}
```

### Other useful functions:

- `fitAndCenter(): void`: Call it to fit and center the tree (omg really?)
- `setTree(tree: Node[], preservePositionAndScale: boolean = false): void`: Call it to set the tree programmatically.

## Customizations

### Advanced customizations

FirJs provide this methods to override your data:

- `overrideLabel(node): Promise<string>`: to override your label.
- `overrideIcon(node): Promise<string>`: to assign a dynamic icon.

Both of this functions are executed when a node is drawed.

### Style customizations

You can customize the entire Workspace with only a little bit of CSS. You will find that there are many implemented CSS variables that you can simply override.

## Workspace tips

- Grab an empty point in the workspace with your **left mouse button** and move it to shift the workflow.
- If you want to move the workflow from any position, before to click press and hold the **Ctrl** or the **Space** button.
- Simply zoom with your **mouse wheel**.
- If you are dragging a node and do you want to cancel the drop operation, simply press **Esc**.
- Right click on a component or on workspace to open the contextual menu with some useful actions.

## Next steps

- [ ] Add tests.
- [ ] Angular module.
- [ ] React component.
- [ ] Better event management.
- [ ] More customizations.
- [ ] Better mobile.
